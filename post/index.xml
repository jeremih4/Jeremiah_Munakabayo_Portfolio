      <description>The objective of this challenge is to create a machine translation system capable of converting text from French into Fongbe or Ewe. Fongbe is the major Gbe language of Benin (with approximately 4.1 million speakers), while Ewe is spoken in Togo and southeastern Ghana by approximately 4.5 million people as a first language and by a million others as a second language.
This challenge is part of an initiative that wishes to bring down the barriers between African local language speakers and modern society; non-French/English speakers are often unable to access critical facilities like education, banking, and healthcare.</description>

      <description>As an intern at the University of Melbourne, I used my data science skills to help realize the university&amp;rsquo;s objectives in student access and equity, and improved diversity in the student cohort. They wished to engage and win students of various backgrounds, including, but not limited to, Low Social-Economic student, First Nation students, and Disavantaged Background students.
I was part of a 3-person diverse team, and we examined the VTAC Masterfile dataset that comprised of more than 360 attributes.</description>

      <guid>https://Jeremih4.github.io/Jeremiah_Munakabayo_Portfolio/post/sentiment_nectar/</guid>
      <description>The objective of the project was to perform a city wide sentiment analysis and understand the shifts caused by weather, sporting events, and even the police among other phenomena within the city.
This project was a 5-person project. It was completed on australian cloud platform NeCTAR.
Different aspects of the project included;
 web scrapping (tweet harvesting) tweet sentiment tag automation couchbase and hadoop UI development  My resposibilities were to streamline the automotion process using Boto, and ansible, in order to create and deploy cloud instances on demand, and install all necessary software.</description>

      <description>Eco Spatial Solutions is a project to meet the objectives of the Plan Melbourne 2017-2050 project, which is a long-term plan devised to facilitate sustainable development in Melbourne’s growing future.
This project provides a solution to the Direction 6.7 of the Plan, i.e. to;
 Improve the economic recovery of waste and reduce reliance on landfill Improve waste and resource recovery systems to meet the logistical challenges of medium and higher density developments Protect waste management and resource recovery facilities from urban encroachment and assess opportunities for new waste facilities  motivation</description>

      <title>Multi-armed Bandits</title>

      <description>In this project, I implemented several MAB learners. These leaners include epsilon-Greedy, UCB, and LinUCB (which is adopted from Section 3.1 of the WWW’2010 paper)
The Dataset used is a 2MB .txt file with 1000 lines corresponding to distinct site visits by users.

Multi-armed bandits (MABs) are a powerful tool in statistical machine learning: they bridge decision making, control, optimisation and learning; they address practical problems of sequential decision making while backed by elegant theoretical guarantees; and more subtly they are neither fully supervised nor unsupervised, being partial labelled by indirect rewards.</description>

      <description>I built multiple linear regression models. Collected two datasets from from here and here respectively. First task: predict salary from number of years of experience. Second task: predict miles per gallon in the Auto MPG dataset using tensorflow.    Tools used
 Python sklearn tensorflow keras  link to code</description>
